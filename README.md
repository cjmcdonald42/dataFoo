Minecraft datapack template. \
Datapacks were added in Minecraft 1.13 and have become more robust with each version of Minecraft.

The dataFoo folder is the modpack - move that into your datapack folder. For purposes of this tutorial, I have added a function to give all players the night vision effect as an example.

Format value 15 = Minecraft v1.20 to 1.20.1 \
